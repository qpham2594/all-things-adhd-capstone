# All Things ADHD

## Overview, main features, contributions

This is a NextJS and React app that I am creating for my Capstone project. It is a simple to-do app with the option to also search for recipes based on time or ingredients as well. I like the idea of having some sort of reward for accomplishing my tasks, and so for that, I want pieces of a puzzle to reveal itself once the tasks are complete or crossed off. Even though it is supposed to be a to-do list, users can also use it as a grocery list for the ingredients they need from the recipes as well. The option to search for recipes is through Spoonacular API and will provide 10 recipes at a time. The goal of this app is for me personally to be more productive, feel good for accomplishing the tasks, and also find inpiration to new recipes for myself.

As it is a solo project, there are no contributions of others invovled, and expected no contributions as it is a class project.

## Installation

For this app, I used NextJS, React, MongoDB, NodeJS, Axios, and Nextauth. I have installed the most updated versions for all dependencies, and there is not a "must" version of a certain dependecy that is required as far as I know. There are also no linter tools that was installed for this app.


## Testing

Due to the limited time, there are no tests created for this app, so no testing libary is used here.
