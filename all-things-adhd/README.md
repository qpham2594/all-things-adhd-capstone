# All Things ADHD

## Overview

For this app, I want to create something that is beneficial for those with ADHD like myself, and it can also be something that I can see myself going back to using repeatedly. There are new ADHD information as of the past few years, thanks to the increase diagnosis rate in women that are finally catching up. However, it can be difficult to open different tabs to look for the informmation needed, or having to pay money for a subscription for a to-do app just to help with accomplishing a task that neurotypical individuals have no challenges in getting done. With this app, the goal is to make it free for all who needs it and also let it be a place where ADHD-related resources can also be found. 

## Main features

For bigger tasks, and especially administrative tasks, ADHD individuals (or neurodivergent individuals) tend to have difficulty carrying out those tasks due to the lack of immediate or nontangible reward. Our ADHD brains want the dopamine consistently due to the imbalance, so these bigger or tedious tasks make it agonizing to complete. It's not that we don't want to do it, we consisitently think about it, but we just physically can't bring ourselves to do it. 

This to-do app is a monthly to-do app that allows people like myself to create a list of what we want to accomplish for the month, and then when we complete them, a piece of puzzle is revealed. After 12 months of completion, a whole puzzle is revealed. The reward of putting together a puzzle over time will hopefully motivate users to complete their monthly to-do list and increase productivity. This feature of the app will be the number one goal. 

The secondary focus will be on a recipe search. For a lot of our ADHD individuals, we can go into hyperfocus when we are interested in a topic. While the word "hyperfocus" is being used by almost everyone now, the real hyperfocus that ADHD individuals experience results in forgetting to eat, drink, or use the bathroom. When the body is sending signals that we need them, we don't notice them because we are so focus on what we are doing. As a result, we experience physical symptoms such as feeling sick, cramps, etc. The recipe search feature will allow users to filter out the ingredients and/or restrictions, and set a cooking time limit depending on their motivation. This feature will allow users to find a quick way to feed themselves when they are overwhelmed with that to cook or make. 

## Extra features

To add to the app and increase the user experience, extra features will be added if the main features are successfully built. These extra features include resources to local therapists in the area, the external links to GoodRx and Cost Plus Drugs to help with the medicaiton cost, and external educational links to ADHD-related content such as podcasts, research studies, articles, etc. This will alleviate the extra stress of searching for the information when they can be accessible on the same app.
